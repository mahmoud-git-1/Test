                    <h2>The Foundation of Modern Computing</h2>
                    <p>The motherboard serves as the central nervous system of any computer, providing the physical and electrical connections between all components. From the early breadboard designs of the 1970s to today's sophisticated multi-layer PCBs, motherboards have evolved to support increasingly complex and powerful hardware configurations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Historical Evolution</h3>
                    <p><strong>Early Motherboards (1970s-1980s):</strong> The first motherboards were simple circuit boards with basic component placement. The IBM PC (1981) established the AT form factor, which became the standard for desktop computers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>ATX Revolution (1995):</strong> Intel's ATX specification revolutionized motherboard design with improved layout, better cooling, and standardized connectors. The ATX form factor remains the most popular standard today.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Modern Standards:</strong> Today's motherboards support multiple form factors including ATX, microATX, mini-ITX, and E-ATX, each optimized for different use cases and space constraints.</p>
